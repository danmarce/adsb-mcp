"""MCP server: local ADS-B flight data as tools, over your own receiver's aircraft.json.

Design contract:
  * Live tier (aircraft_overhead / aircraft_near / find_aircraft): the current snapshot — fetched, or the
    background recorder's latest while fresh. Inputs pass through verbatim; resolved parameters are echoed.
  * History tier (traffic_stats / aircraft_history): read the recorder's local store of PASSES.
  * ok / refused / error status on every result — branch on `status`, never on prose.
  * The receiver location is home-location PII: it comes from env, never the repo, and is NEVER echoed in a
    result (distances and bearings only). The airport, a public place, may be.

INSTRUCTIONS = """\
Aircraft seen by a local ADS-B receiver (its keyless aircraft.json — your OWN data). Live tools:
aircraft_overhead (what's in range now, nearest first), aircraft_near (within a radius of a given point),
find_aircraft (by callsign / hex / registration). The star query is "¿qué avión es ese?" — what's flying
overhead right now. History tools (when the server records): traffic_stats (most / least common airframes,
callsigns, types, outcomes, busiest hours over a window) and aircraft_history ("have we seen this one
before?" — the past passes of an airframe / callsign / registration).

Results are structured DATA (hex, callsign, registration, type, altitude_ft, ground_speed_kt, track_deg,
lat/lon, distance_km + bearing_deg from the reference point, seen_s). Answer in the user's language; cite
that it's local ADS-B. Altitudes are feet, speed knots, track/bearing degrees.

A PASS is one visit of an aircraft through the receiver's area (one row, not one per poll). With an airport
configured each pass has an outcome: arrival (seen landing), arrival_presumed (lost on approach — coverage
usually ends before the runway), go_around, departure or overflight; go_arounds counts missed approaches.
Three different "most common" questions: airframe (hex/registration — the physical aircraft), callsign
(the route/service), type (the model).

ADS-B carries no route — only what the aircraft transmits. When the operator enables enrichment, past
passes get origin/destination airports (ICAO codes, from OpenSky, learned the day after), and live aircraft
carry `usual_route`: where that callsign has usually flown (`seen` of `of` past passes) — a strong hint,
not a flight plan; say so ("usually flies to SPJC, Lima"). `unusual_route` on a past pass marks one that
differed from its callsign's usual route (a diversion, an unscheduled landing).

Every result has a `status`: "ok", "refused" (caller-fixable input or a tier not enabled, with `advice`),
or "error" (the receiver is unreachable — `kind`+`detail`; not something a reworded query fixes).
