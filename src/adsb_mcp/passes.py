"""The recorder: turn a stream of aircraft.json snapshots into PASSES (one row per visit, not per poll).

A pass opens when an airborne aircraft is inside the zone — within `pass_radius_km` of the reference point
(the site, else the airport), or on approach to the airport. While it's open, every snapshot the aircraft
appears in updates it (altitudes, closest approach, RSSI), so the exit is captured too. It closes once the
aircraft has been gone, or out of the zone, for `pass_grace_s`. If it comes back within `pass_merge_s` of
closing, that pass is reopened (a coverage gap must not split one visit) — unless it ended with a confirmed
landing.

Arrival tracking (needs the airport position + field elevation). ADS-B coverage usually ends before the
runway, so an aircraft lost while ON APPROACH is kept open for `arrival_grace_s`: it's presumably landing.
The heuristics are deliberately simple and documented here:
  * on approach   : within `approach_km` of the airport, below 10,000 ft above the field, descending ≥ 300 fpm.
  * landed        : on the ground within 5 km of the airport after an approach (confirmed).
  * go-around     : after getting below 2,000 ft above the field, climbing ≥ 700 ft back up at ≥ 500 fpm
                    within 15 km of the airport. Counted, and the approach must re-arm to count another.
  * departure     : first seen airborne within 10 km of the airport, below 3,000 ft above it, climbing ≥ 300 fpm.
Outcome on close: arrival (landed seen) > arrival_presumed (lost on approach) > go_around (went around,
then left) > departure > overflight. Without arrival tracking the outcome is null.

Feeder-down is NOT absence: a failed poll touches no pass (see `poll_once`), so an outage never closes or
splits the passes that were open.
