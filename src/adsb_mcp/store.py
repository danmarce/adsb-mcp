"""SQLite store for the historical tier: one row per PASS (a visit), never one per poll.

ACCUMULATES and is not reproducible (the live feed is gone once it's gone) — back the file up. Open passes
are written through on every poll (`open=1`), so a restart resumes them instead of losing or splitting them.
No coordinates are stored: distances only, so the file never holds the receiver's location.
