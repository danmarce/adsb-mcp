"""Enrichment: origin / destination for recorded passes, from the OpenSky Network — earned, good-citizen.

Why OpenSky, and why this shape:
  * Access is EARNED by feeding: an active feeder (receiver online > 30% of the month) gets 8,000 credits a
    day. The server only spends them on aircraft its own receiver saw.
  * OpenSky's flight data (`/flights/aircraft`: estDepartureAirport / estArrivalAirport) is batch-processed
    overnight, so it can't answer about a flight in progress. The job enriches YESTERDAY's passes, after
    `READY_AFTER_S` past midnight UTC, and learns: the next time that callsign passes, the history says
    where it usually goes (`usual_route`).
  * At most ONE call per airframe per UTC day, however many passes it made (`opensky_lookups` remembers).
    An empty answer is retried a few times (the batch may lag), then given up. A daily credit cap
    (`ADSB_OPENSKY_DAILY_CREDITS`), a reserve read from `X-Rate-Limit-Remaining` (`ADSB_OPENSKY_RESERVE`), and
    HTTP 429's retry-after all stop the job for the day.
  * Only this background job talks to OpenSky. The MCP tools read the local store, so they stay
    openWorldHint=false; the README says plainly that the server contacts OpenSky when configured.
